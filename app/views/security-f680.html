        <p>The grading can sometimes include a prefix and suffix. There are many in use and so it is important that you know the full classification of the product.</p>

        <p>If the product was developed with Ministry of Defence (MOD) funding you will find the grading in the Security Aspects Letter provided by the MOD project team.</p>

        <p>If the product was developed with overseas government support, that government is responsible for providing the grading.</p>

        <p>If the product was developed without UK or overseas government support, you should apply for a private venture grading using <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk">SPIRE</a>. The grading will be provided by MOD.</p>
