    <p>An end-user receives the products in the destination country. They either use the products themselves, resell from stock, or export them again to another country.</p>
    <p>A consignee receives the products and then delivers them to the end-user.</p>
    <p>A third party is involved in the export but not regarded as a consignee, end-user or ultimate end-user, for example they might be an agent, broker, consultant or distributor.</p>
    <p>For products being processed or incorporated and then exported again passed their first destination, there may also be an ultimate end-user. An ultimate end-user in a third country receives goods via an onward export from the end user.</p>
